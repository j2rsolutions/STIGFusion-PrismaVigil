  "description": "This custom runtime rule is designed to monitor and alert on any changes to the Apache service account's login shell or password status. It ensures compliance with STIG Finding V-214271, which states that the account used to run the Apache web server must not have a valid login shell and password defined. The rule focuses on detecting unauthorized modifications that could grant login capabilities to the Apache service account, potentially compromising system security.",
  "message": "Potential Compliance Deviation Detected: An action has been observed that might alter the login shell or password of the Apache service account, potentially conflicting with STIG Finding V-214271. Immediate investigation is required to ensure that the account used to run the Apache web server does not possess a valid login shell and password.",
