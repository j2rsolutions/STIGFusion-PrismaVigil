| V-214245 | medium | The Apache web server must have Web Distributed Authoring (WebDAV) disabled. | A web server can be installed with functionality that, by its nature, is not secure. WebDAV is an extension to the HTTP protocol that, when developed, was meant to allow users to create, change, and move documents on a server, typically a web server or web share. Allowing this functionality, development, and deployment is much easier for web authors.<br><br>WebDAV is not widely used and has serious security concerns because it may allow clients to modify unauthorized files on the web server. | [STIG_Apache2.4_processes_a2enmod](https://github.com/j2rsolutions/STIGFusion-PrismaVigil/tree/main/STIGS/apache_server_2.4_unix_server/custom_runtime_rules/STIG_Apache2.4_processes_a2enmod), [STIG_Apache2.4_ConfigMultiFindings](https://github.com/j2rsolutions/STIGFusion-PrismaVigil/tree/main/STIGS/apache_server_2.4_unix_server/custom_runtime_rules/STIG_Apache2.4_ConfigMultiFindings) | [V-214245](https://github.com/j2rsolutions/STIGFusion-PrismaVigil/tree/main/STIGS/apache_server_2.4_unix_server/custom_compliance_checks/medium/V-214245) | testing | jonathan |  |
| V-214264 | medium | The Apache web server must be configured to integrate with an organizations security infrastructure. | A web server will typically use logging mechanisms for maintaining a historical log of activity that occurs within a hosted application. This information can then be used for diagnostic purposes, forensics purposes, or other purposes relevant to ensuring the availability and integrity of the hosted application.<br><br>While it is important to log events identified as being critical and relevant to security, it is equally important to notify the appropriate personnel in a timely manner so they are able to respond to events as they occur. <br><br>Manual review of the web server logs may not occur in a timely manner, and each event logged is open to interpretation by a reviewer. By integrating the web server into an overall or organization-wide log review, a larger picture of events can be viewed, and analysis can be done in a timely and reliable manner. | V-214264 requires a manual verification process to ensure that the SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system is fully integrated within the organization's comprehensive security framework. As this is a procedural check, there is no technical fix to apply. It involves a review to confirm that the SIEM is effectively correlated with the organization's security policies and practices. | [V-214264](https://github.com/j2rsolutions/STIGFusion-PrismaVigil/tree/main/STIGS/apache_server_2.4_unix_server/custom_compliance_checks/medium/V-214264) | done | jonathan |  |
| V-214243 | medium | The Apache web server must have resource mappings set to disable the serving of certain file types. | Resource mapping is the process of tying a particular file type to a process in the web server that can serve that type of file to a requesting client and to identify which file types are not to be delivered to a client.<br><br>By not specifying which files can and cannot be served to a user, the web server could deliver to a user web server configuration files, log files, password files, etc.<br><br>The web server must only allow hosted application file types to be served to a user, and all other types must be disabled.<br><br>Satisfies: SRG-APP-000141-WSR-000081, SRG-APP-000141-WSR-000083 | [STIG_Apache2.4_ConfigMultiFindings](https://github.com/j2rsolutions/STIGFusion-PrismaVigil/tree/main/STIGS/apache_server_2.4_unix_server/custom_runtime_rules/STIG_Apache2.4_ConfigMultiFindings) | [V-214243](https://github.com/j2rsolutions/STIGFusion-PrismaVigil/tree/main/STIGS/apache_server_2.4_unix_server/custom_compliance_checks/medium/V-214243) | testing | jonathan |  |
| V-214240 | medium | The Apache web server must only contain services and functions necessary for operation. | A web server can provide many features, services, and processes. Some of these may be deemed unnecessary or too unsecure to run on a production DoD system.<br><br>The web server must provide the capability to disable, uninstall, or deactivate functionality and services that are deemed to be non-essential to the web server mission or can adversely impact server performance. |  | [V-214240](https://github.com/j2rsolutions/STIGFusion-PrismaVigil/tree/main/STIGS/apache_server_2.4_unix_server/custom_compliance_checks/medium/V-214240) |  |  |  |
| V-214238 | medium | Expansion modules must be fully reviewed, tested, and signed before they can exist on a production Apache web server. | In the case of a production web server, areas for content development and testing will not exist, as this type of content is only permissible on a development website. The process of developing on a functional production website entails a degree of trial and error and repeated testing. This process is often accomplished in an environment where debugging, sequencing, and formatting of content are the main goals. The opportunity for a malicious user to obtain files that reveal business logic and logon schemes is high in this situation. The existence of such immature content on a web server represents a significant security risk that is totally avoidable.<br><br>The web server must enforce, internally or through an external utility, the signing of modules before they are implemented into a production environment. By signing modules, the author guarantees that the module has been reviewed and tested before production implementation. |  | [V-214238](https://github.com/j2rsolutions/STIGFusion-PrismaVigil/tree/main/STIGS/apache_server_2.4_unix_server/custom_compliance_checks/medium/V-214238) |  |  |  |
| V-214268 | medium | Cookies exchanged between the Apache web server and the client, such as session cookies, must have cookie properties set to prohibit client-side scripts from reading the cookie data. | A cookie can be read by client-side scripts easily if cookie properties are not set properly. By allowing cookies to be read by the client-side scripts, information such as session identifiers could be compromised and used by an attacker who intercepts the cookie. Setting cookie properties (i.e., HttpOnly property) to disallow client-side scripts from reading cookies better protects the information inside the cookie.<br><br>Satisfies: SRG-APP-000439-WSR-000154, SRG-APP-000439-WSR-000155 |  | [V-214268](https://github.com/j2rsolutions/STIGFusion-PrismaVigil/tree/main/STIGS/apache_server_2.4_unix_server/custom_compliance_checks/medium/V-214268) |  |  |  |
| V-214269 | medium | The Apache web server must remove all export ciphers to protect the confidentiality and integrity of transmitted information. | During the initial setup of a Transport Layer Security (TLS) connection to the Apache web server, the client sends a list of supported cipher suites in order of preference. The Apache web server will reply with the cipher suite it will use for communication from the client list. If an attacker can intercept the submission of cipher suites to the Apache web server and place, as the preferred cipher suite, a weak export suite, the encryption used for the session becomes easy for the attacker to break, often within minutes to hours.<br><br>Configuring the Apache server with only strong ciphersuites, denying or disabling weak ciphersuites, will prevent this vulnerability. |  | [V-214269](https://github.com/j2rsolutions/STIGFusion-PrismaVigil/tree/main/STIGS/apache_server_2.4_unix_server/custom_compliance_checks/medium/V-214269) |  |  |  |
| V-214260 | medium | The Apache web server must be configured to immediately disconnect or disable remote access to the hosted applications. | During an attack on the Apache web server or any of the hosted applications, the System Administrator (SA) may need to disconnect or disable access by users to stop the attack.<br><br>The Apache web server must be configured to disconnect users from a hosted application without compromising other hosted applications unless deemed necessary to stop the attack. Methods to disconnect or disable connections are to stop the application service for a specified hosted application, stop the Apache web server, or block all connections through the Apache web server access list.<br><br>The Apache web server capabilities used to disconnect or disable users from connecting to hosted applications and the Apache web server must be documented to make certain that, during an attack, the proper action is taken to conserve connectivity to any other hosted application if possible and to make certain log data is conserved for later forensic analysis. |  | [V-214260](https://github.com/j2rsolutions/STIGFusion-PrismaVigil/tree/main/STIGS/apache_server_2.4_unix_server/custom_compliance_checks/medium/V-214260) |  |  |  |
| V-214248 | high | Apache web server application directories,  libraries, and configuration files must only be accessible to privileged users. | By separating Apache web server security functions from non-privileged users, roles can be developed that can then be used to administer the Apache web server. Forcing users to change from a non-privileged account to a privileged account when operating on the Apache web server or on security-relevant information forces users to only operate as a Web Server Administrator when necessary. Operating in this manner allows for better logging of changes and better forensic information and limits accidental changes to the Apache web server.<br><br>To limit changes to the Apache web server and limit exposure to any adverse effects from the changes, files such as the Apache web server application files, libraries, and configuration files must have permissions and ownership set properly to only allow privileged users access. |  | [V-214248](https://github.com/j2rsolutions/STIGFusion-PrismaVigil/tree/main/STIGS/apache_server_2.4_unix_server/custom_compliance_checks/high/V-214248) |  |  |  |
| V-214249 | medium | The Apache web server must separate the hosted applications from hosted Apache web server management functionality. | The separation of user functionality from web server management can be accomplished by moving management functions to a separate IP address or port. To further separate the management functions, separate authentication methods and certificates should be used.<br><br>By moving the management functionality, the possibility of accidental discovery of the management functions by non-privileged users during hosted application use is minimized. |  | [V-214249](https://github.com/j2rsolutions/STIGFusion-PrismaVigil/tree/main/STIGS/apache_server_2.4_unix_server/custom_compliance_checks/medium/V-214249) |  |  |  |
| V-214246 | medium | The Apache web server must be configured to use a specified IP address and port. | The web server must be configured to listen on a specified IP address and port. Without specifying an IP address and port for the web server to use, the web server will listen on all IP addresses available to the hosting server. If the web server has multiple IP addresses, i.e., a management IP address, the web server will also accept connections on the management IP address.<br><br>Accessing the hosted application through an IP address normally used for non-application functions opens the possibility of user access to resources, utilities, files, ports, and protocols that are protected on the desired application IP address.<br><br>Satisfies: SRG-APP-000142-WSR-000089, SRG-APP-000176-WSR-000096 |  | [V-214246](https://github.com/j2rsolutions/STIGFusion-PrismaVigil/tree/main/STIGS/apache_server_2.4_unix_server/custom_compliance_checks/medium/V-214246) |  |  |  |
| V-214247 | medium | Apache web server accounts accessing the directory tree, the shell, or other operating system functions and utilities must only be administrative accounts. | As a rule, accounts on a web server are to be kept to a minimum. Only administrators, web managers, developers, auditors, and web authors require accounts on the machine hosting the web server. The resources to which these accounts have access must also be closely monitored and controlled. Only the system administrator needs access to all the system's capabilities, while the web administrator and associated staff require access and control of the web content and web server configuration files. |  | [V-214247](https://github.com/j2rsolutions/STIGFusion-PrismaVigil/tree/main/STIGS/apache_server_2.4_unix_server/custom_compliance_checks/medium/V-214247) |  |  |  |
| V-214244 | medium | The Apache web server must allow the mappings to unused and vulnerable scripts to be removed. | Scripts allow server-side processing on behalf of the hosted application user or as processes needed in the implementation of hosted applications. Removing scripts not needed for application operation or deemed vulnerable helps to secure the web server.<br><br>To ensure scripts are not added to the web server and run maliciously, script mappings that are not needed or used by the web server for hosted application operation must be removed. |  | [V-214244](https://github.com/j2rsolutions/STIGFusion-PrismaVigil/tree/main/STIGS/apache_server_2.4_unix_server/custom_compliance_checks/medium/V-214244) |  |  |  |
| V-214263 | medium | The Apache web server must not impede the ability to write specified log record content to an audit log server. | Writing events to a centralized management audit system offers many benefits to the enterprise over having dispersed logs. Centralized management of audit records and logs provides for efficiency in maintenance and management of records, enterprise analysis of events, and backup and archiving of event records enterprise-wide. The web server and related components are required to be capable of writing logs to centralized audit log servers. |  | [V-214263](https://github.com/j2rsolutions/STIGFusion-PrismaVigil/tree/main/STIGS/apache_server_2.4_unix_server/custom_compliance_checks/medium/V-214263) |  |  |  |
| V-214228 | medium | The Apache web server must limit the number of allowed simultaneous session requests. | Apache web server management includes the ability to control the number of users and user sessions that utilize an Apache web server. Limiting the number of allowed users and sessions per user is helpful in limiting risks related to several types of denial-of-service (DOS) attacks.<br><br>Although there is some latitude concerning the settings, they should follow DoD-recommended values and be configurable to allow for future DoD direction. While the DoD will specify recommended values, the values can be adjusted to accommodate the operational requirements of a given system. |  | [V-214228](https://github.com/j2rsolutions/STIGFusion-PrismaVigil/tree/main/STIGS/apache_server_2.4_unix_server/custom_compliance_checks/medium/V-214228) |  |  |  |
| V-214229 | medium | The Apache web server must perform server-side session management. | Session management is the practice of protecting the bulk of the user authorization and identity information. This data can be stored on the client system or on the server.<br><br>When the session information is stored on the client, the session ID, along with the user authorization and identity information, is sent along with each client request and is stored in a cookie, embedded in the uniform resource locator (URL), or placed in a hidden field on the displayed form. Each of these offers advantages and disadvantages. The biggest disadvantage to all three is the possibility of the hijacking of a session along with all of the user's credentials.<br><br>When the user authorization and identity information is stored on the server in a protected and encrypted database, the communication between the client and Apache web server will only send the session identifier, and the server can then retrieve user credentials for the session when needed. If, during transmission, the session were to be hijacked, the user's credentials would not be compromised. |  | [V-214229](https://github.com/j2rsolutions/STIGFusion-PrismaVigil/tree/main/STIGS/apache_server_2.4_unix_server/custom_compliance_checks/medium/V-214229) |  |  |  |
| V-214266 | medium | The Apache web server must prohibit or restrict the use of nonsecure or unnecessary ports, protocols, modules, and/or services. | Web servers provide numerous processes, features, and functionalities that use TCP/IP ports. Some of these processes may be deemed unnecessary or too unsecure to run on a production system.<br><br>The Apache web server must provide the capability to disable or deactivate network-related services that are deemed to be non-essential to the server mission, are too unsecure, or are prohibited by the Ports, Protocols, and Services Management (PPSM) Category Assurance List (CAL) and vulnerability assessments. |  | [V-214266](https://github.com/j2rsolutions/STIGFusion-PrismaVigil/tree/main/STIGS/apache_server_2.4_unix_server/custom_compliance_checks/medium/V-214266) |  |  |  |
| V-214241 | medium | The Apache web server must not be a proxy server. | A web server should be primarily a web server or a proxy server but not both, for the same reasons that other multi-use servers are not recommended. Scanning for web servers that will also proxy requests into an otherwise protected network is a very common attack, making the attack anonymous. |  | [V-214241](https://github.com/j2rsolutions/STIGFusion-PrismaVigil/tree/main/STIGS/apache_server_2.4_unix_server/custom_compliance_checks/medium/V-214241) |  |  |  |
| V-214265 | medium | The Apache web server must generate log records that can be mapped to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) or Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) which are stamped at a minimum granularity of one second. | If time stamps are not consistently applied and there is no common time reference, it is difficult to perform forensic analysis across multiple devices and log records.<br><br>Time stamps generated by the Apache web server include date and time. Time is commonly expressed in UTC, a modern continuation of GMT, or local time with an offset from UTC.<br><br>Without sufficient granularity of time stamps, it is not possible to adequately determine the chronological order of records.<br><br>Time stamps generated by the Apache web server include date and time and must be to a granularity of one second.<br><br>Satisfies: SRG-APP-000374-WSR-000172, SRG-APP-000375-WSR-000171 |  | [V-214265](https://github.com/j2rsolutions/STIGFusion-PrismaVigil/tree/main/STIGS/apache_server_2.4_unix_server/custom_compliance_checks/medium/V-214265) |  |  |  |
| V-214256 | medium | Warning and error messages displayed to clients must be modified to minimize the identity of the Apache web server, patches, loaded modules, and directory paths. | Information needed by an attacker to begin looking for possible vulnerabilities in a web server includes any information about the web server, backend systems being accessed, and plug-ins or modules being used.<br><br>Web servers will often display error messages to client users, displaying enough information to aid in the debugging of the error. The information given back in error messages may display the web server type, version, patches installed, plug-ins and modules installed, type of code being used by the hosted application, and any backends being used for data storage.<br><br>This information could be used by an attacker to blueprint what type of attacks might be successful. The information given to users must be minimized to not aid in the blueprinting of the Apache web server. |  | [V-214256](https://github.com/j2rsolutions/STIGFusion-PrismaVigil/tree/main/STIGS/apache_server_2.4_unix_server/custom_compliance_checks/medium/V-214256) |  |  |  |
| V-214242 | high | The Apache web server must provide install options to exclude the installation of documentation, sample code, example applications, and tutorials. | Apache web server documentation, sample code, example applications, and tutorials may be an exploitable threat to an Apache web server because this type of code has not been evaluated and approved. A production Apache web server must only contain components that are operationally necessary (e.g., compiled code, scripts, web content, etc.).<br><br>Any documentation, sample code, example applications, and tutorials must be removed from a production Apache web server. To ensure that the documentation and code are not installed or are uninstalled completely, the Apache web server must offer an option as part of the installation process to exclude these packages or to uninstall the packages if necessary.<br><br>Satisfies: SRG-APP-000141-WSR-000077, SRG-APP-000141-WSR-000080 | [STIG_Apache2.4_ConfigMultiFindings](https://github.com/j2rsolutions/STIGFusion-PrismaVigil/tree/main/STIGS/apache_server_2.4_unix_server/custom_runtime_rules/STIG_Apache2.4_ConfigMultiFindings) | [V-214242](https://github.com/j2rsolutions/STIGFusion-PrismaVigil/tree/main/STIGS/apache_server_2.4_unix_server/custom_compliance_checks/high/V-214242) | Done | jonathan |  |
| V-214237 | medium | The log data and records from the Apache web server must be backed up onto a different system or media. | Protection of log data includes ensuring log data is not accidentally lost or deleted. Backing up log records to an unrelated system or onto separate media than the system the web server is actually running on helps to ensure that, in the event of a catastrophic system failure, the log records will be retained. |  | [V-214237](https://github.com/j2rsolutions/STIGFusion-PrismaVigil/tree/main/STIGS/apache_server_2.4_unix_server/custom_compliance_checks/medium/V-214237) |  |  |  |
| V-214236 | medium | The log information from the Apache web server must be protected from unauthorized modification or deletion. | Log data is essential in the investigation of events. If log data were to become compromised, competent forensic analysis and discovery of the true source of potentially malicious system activity would be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve. In addition, access to log records provides information an attacker could potentially use to their advantage since each event record might contain communication ports, protocols, services, trust relationships, user names, etc.<br><br>The web server must protect the log data from unauthorized read, write, copy, etc. This can be done by the web server if the web server is also doing the logging function. The web server may also use an external log system. In either case, the logs must be protected from access by non-privileged users.<br><br>Satisfies: SRG-APP-000119-WSR-000069, SRG-APP-000120-WSR-000070 |  | [V-214236](https://github.com/j2rsolutions/STIGFusion-PrismaVigil/tree/main/STIGS/apache_server_2.4_unix_server/custom_compliance_checks/medium/V-214236) |  |  |  |
| V-214261 | medium | Non-privileged accounts on the hosting system must only access Apache web server security-relevant information and functions through a distinct administrative account. | By separating Apache web server security functions from non-privileged users, roles can be developed that can then be used to administer the Apache web server. Forcing users to change from a non-privileged account to a privileged account when operating on the Apache web server or on security-relevant information forces users to only operate as a Web Server Administrator when necessary.

| V-214234 | medium | The Apache web server must use a logging mechanism that is configured to alert the Information System Security Officer (ISSO) and System Administrator (SA) in the event of a processing failure. | Reviewing log data allows an investigator to recreate the path of an attacker and to capture forensic data for later use. Log data is also essential to SAs in their daily administrative duties on the hosted system or within the hosted applications.<br><br>If the logging system begins to fail, events will not be recorded. Organizations must define logging failure events, at which time the application or the logging mechanism the application uses will provide a warning to the ISSO and SA at a minimum.<br><br>Satisfies: SRG-APP-000108-WSR-000166, SRG-APP-000359-WSR-000065 |  | [V-214234](https://github.com/j2rsolutions/STIGFusion-PrismaVigil/tree/main/STIGS/apache_server_2.4_unix_server/custom_compliance_checks/medium/V-214234) |  |  |  |
| V-214233 | medium | An Apache web server, behind a load balancer or proxy server, must produce log records containing the client IP information as the source and destination and not the load balancer or proxy IP information with each event. | Apache web server logging capability is critical for accurate forensic analysis. Without sufficient and accurate information, a correct replay of the events cannot be determined.<br><br>Ascertaining the correct source of the events (e.g., source IP) is important during forensic analysis. Correctly determining the source of events will add information to the overall reconstruction of the loggable event. By determining the source of the event correctly, analysis of the enterprise can be undertaken to determine if events tied to the source occurred in other areas within the enterprise.<br><br>A web server behind a load balancer or proxy server, when not configured correctly, will record the load balancer or proxy server as the source of every loggable event. When looking at the information forensically, this information is not helpful in the investigation of events. The web server must record with each event the client source of the event. |  | [V-214233](https://github.com/j2rsolutions/STIGFusion-PrismaVigil/tree/main/STIGS/apache_server_2.4_unix_server/custom_compliance_checks/medium/V-214233) |  |  |  |
| V-214231 | medium | The Apache web server must have system logging enabled. | The server error logs are invaluable because they can also be used to identify potential problems and enable proactive remediation. Log data can reveal anomalous behavior such as “not found” or “unauthorized” errors that may be an evidence of attack attempts. Failure to enable error logging can significantly reduce the ability of Web Administrators to detect or remediate problems. The CustomLog directive specifies the log file, syslog facility, or piped logging utility. |  | [V-214231](https://github.com/j2rsolutions/STIGFusion-PrismaVigil/tree/main/STIGS/apache_server_2.4_unix_server/custom_compliance_checks/medium/V-214231) |  |  |  |
| V-214232 | medium | The Apache web server must generate, at a minimum, log records for system startup and shutdown, system access, and system authentication events. | Log records can be generated from various components within the Apache web server (e.g., httpd, plug-ins to external backends, etc.). From a web server perspective, certain specific Apache web server functionalities may be logged as well. The Apache web server must allow the definition of what events are to be logged. As conditions change, the number and types of events to be logged may change, and the Apache web server must be able to facilitate these changes.<br><br>The minimum list of logged events should be those pertaining to system startup and shutdown, system access, and system authentication events. If these events are not logged at a minimum, any type of forensic investigation would be missing pertinent information needed to replay what occurred.<br><br><br>Satisfies: SRG-APP-000089-WSR-000047, SRG-APP-000092-WSR-000055, SRG-APP-000095-WSR-000056, SRG-APP-000096-WSR-000057, SRG-APP-000097-WSR-000058, SRG-APP-000098-WSR-000059, SRG-APP-000099-WSR-000061, SRG-APP-000100-WSR-000064 |  | [V-214232](https://github.com/j2rsolutions/STIGFusion-PrismaVigil/tree/main/STIGS/apache_server_2.4_unix_server/custom_compliance_checks/medium/V-214232) |  |  |  |
| V-214251 | medium | Cookies exchanged between the Apache web server and client, such as session cookies, must have security settings that disallow cookie access outside the originating Apache web server and hosted application. | Cookies are used to exchange data between the web server and the client. Cookies, such as a session cookie, may contain session information and user credentials used to maintain a persistent connection between the user and the hosted application since HTTP/HTTPS is a stateless protocol.<br><br>When the cookie parameters are not set properly (i.e., domain and path parameters), cookies can be shared within hosted applications residing on the same web server or to applications hosted on different web servers residing on the same domain. |  | [V-214251](https://github.com/j2rsolutions/STIGFusion-PrismaVigil/tree/main/STIGS/apache_server_2.4_unix_server/custom_compliance_checks/medium/V-214251) |  |  |  |
| V-214250 | medium | The Apache web server must invalidate session identifiers upon hosted application user logout or other session termination. | Captured sessions can be reused in "replay" attacks.

Nonsecure zones are defined as any IP, subnet, or region that is defined as a threat to the organization. The nonsecure zones must be defined for public web servers logically located in a DMZ, as well as private web servers with perimeter protection devices.
