| V-235148 | high | The MySQL Database Server 8.0 must use NIST FIPS 140-2 or 140-3 validated cryptographic modules for cryptographic operations. | Use of weak or not validated cryptographic algorithms undermines the purposes of utilizing encryption and digital signatures to protect data. Weak algorithms can be easily broken and not validated cryptographic modules may not implement algorithms correctly. Unapproved cryptographic modules or algorithms should not be relied on for authentication, confidentiality, or integrity. Weak cryptography could allow an attacker to gain access to and modify data stored in the database as well as the administration settings of the Database Management System (DBMS).<br><br>Applications, including DBMSs, utilizing cryptography are required to use approved NIST FIPS 140-2 or 140-3 validated cryptographic modules that meet the requirements of applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance.  <br><br>NSA Type-X (where X=1, 2, 3, 4) products are NSA-certified, hardware-based encryption modules.<br><br>The standard for validating cryptographic modules will transition to the NIST FIPS 140-3 publication.<br><br>FIPS 140-2 modules can remain active for up to five years after validation or until September 21, 2026, when the FIPS 140-2 validations will be moved to the historical list. Even on the historical list, CMVP supports the purchase and use of these modules for existing systems. While Federal Agencies decide when they move to FIPS 140-3 only modules, purchasers are reminded that for several years there may be a limited selection of FIPS 140-3 modules from which to choose. CMVP recommends purchasers consider all modules that appear on the Validated Modules Search Page:<br>https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/validated-modules<br><br>More information on the FIPS 140-3 transition can be found here: <br>https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/fips-140-3-transition-effort/ |  |  |  |  |  |
| V-235149 | medium | The MySQL Database Server 8.0 must uniquely identify and authenticate non-organizational users (or processes acting on behalf of non-organizational users). | Non-organizational users include all information system users other than organizational users, which include organizational employees or individuals the organization deems to have equivalent status of employees (e.g., contractors, guest researchers, individuals from allied nations). <br><br>Non-organizational users will be uniquely identified and authenticated for all accesses other than those accesses explicitly identified and documented by the organization when related to the use of anonymous access, such as accessing a web server.  <br><br>Accordingly, a risk assessment is used in determining the authentication needs of the organization. <br><br>Scalability, practicality, and security are simultaneously considered in balancing the need to ensure ease of use for access to federal information and information systems with the need to protect and adequately mitigate risk to organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. |  |  |  |  |  |
| V-235140 | high | The MySQL Database Server 8.0 must obscure feedback of authentication information during the authentication process to protect the information from possible exploitation/use by unauthorized individuals. | The DoD standard for authentication is DoD-approved PKI certificates.<br><br>Normally, with PKI authentication, the interaction with the user for authentication will be handled by a software component separate from the Database Management System (DBMS), such as ActivIdentity ActivClient. However, in cases where the DBMS controls the interaction, this requirement applies.<br><br>To prevent the compromise of authentication information such as passwords and PINs during the authentication process, the feedback from the system must not provide any information that would allow an unauthorized user to compromise the authentication mechanism. <br><br>Obfuscation of user-provided authentication secrets when typed into the system is a method used in addressing this risk. <br><br>Displaying asterisks when a user types in a password or a smart card PIN is an example of obscuring feedback of authentication secrets.<br><br>For mysql tools, which can accept a plain-text password, and any other essential tool with the same limitation:<br>1) Document the need for it, who uses it, and any relevant mitigations, and obtain Authorizing Official (AO) approval<br>2) Train all users of the tool in the importance of not using the plain-text password option and in how to keep the password hidden by using the "-p" without the password option. The user will then be prompted and the password obfuscated.<br>3) Make use of OS pluggable password manager integration to protect passwords using keyrings |  |  |  |  |  |
| V-235141 | high | The MySQL Database Server 8.0 must enforce approved authorizations for logical access to information and system resources in accordance with applicable access control policies. | Authentication with a DoD-approved PKI certificate does not necessarily imply authorization to access the Database Management System (DBMS). To mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information by entities that have been issued certificates by DoD-approved PKIs, all DoD systems, including databases, must be properly configured to implement access control policies. <br><br>Successful authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security boundary. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization. Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement. <br><br>Access control policies include identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. Access enforcement mechanisms include access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography. These policies and mechanisms must be employed by the application to control access between users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes, programs, and domains) in the information system. <br><br>This requirement is applicable to access control enforcement applications, a category that includes database management systems. If the DBMS does not follow applicable policy when approving access, it may be in conflict with networks or other applications in the information system. This may result in users either gaining or being denied access inappropriately and in conflict with applicable policy. |  |  |  |  |  |
| V-235142 | medium | The MySQL Database Server 8.0 must be configured in accordance with the security configuration settings based on DoD security configuration and implementation guidance, including STIGs, NSA configuration guides, CTOs, DTMs, and IAVMs. | Configuring the Database Management System (DBMS) to implement organization-wide security implementation guides and security checklists ensures compliance with federal standards and establishes a common security baseline across DoD that reflects the most restrictive security posture consistent with operational requirements. <br><br>In addition to this SRG, sources of guidance on security and information assurance exist. These include NSA configuration guides, CTOs, DTMs, and IAVMs. The DBMS must be configured in compliance with guidance from all such relevant sources. |  |  |  |  |  |
| V-235143 | medium | Default demonstration and sample databases, database objects, and applications must be removed. | Information systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions).<br><br>It is detrimental for software products to provide, or install by default, functionality exceeding requirements or mission objectives. Examples include, but are not limited to, installing advertising software, demonstrations, or browser plugins not related to requirements or providing a wide array of functionality, not required for every mission, that cannot be disabled.<br><br>Database Management Systems (DBMSs) must adhere to the principles of least functionality by providing only essential capabilities.<br><br>Demonstration and sample database objects and applications present publicly known attack points for malicious users. These demonstration and sample objects are meant to provide simple examples of coding specific functions and are not developed to prevent vulnerabilities from being introduced to the DBMS and host system. |  |  |  |  |  |
| V-235144 | medium | Unused database components, MySQL Database Server 8.0 software, and database objects must be removed. | Information systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions).<br><br>It is detrimental for software products to provide, or install by default, functionality exceeding requirements or mission objectives. <br><br>Database Management Systems (DBMSs) must adhere to the principles of least functionality by providing only essential capabilities. |  |  |  |  |  |
| V-235145 | medium | Unused database components which are integrated in the MySQL Database Server 8.0 and cannot be uninstalled must be disabled. | Information systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions).  <br><br>It is detrimental for software products to provide, or install by default, functionality exceeding requirements or mission objectives.  <br><br>Database Management Systems (DBMSs) must adhere to the principles of least functionality by providing only essential capabilities.<br><br>Unused, unnecessary DBMS components increase the attack vector for the DBMS by introducing additional targets for attack. By minimizing the services and applications installed on the system, the number of potential vulnerabilities is reduced. Components of the system that are unused and cannot be uninstalled must be disabled. The techniques available for disabling components will vary by DBMS product, OS and the nature of the component and may include DBMS configuration settings, OS service settings, OS file access security, and DBMS user/group permissions. |  |  |  |  |  |
| V-235146 | medium | The MySQL Database Server 8.0 must be configured to prohibit or restrict the use of organization-defined functions, ports, protocols, and/or services, as defined in the PPSM CAL and vulnerability assessments. | To prevent unauthorized connection of devices, unauthorized transfer of information, or unauthorized tunneling (i.e., embedding of data types within data types), organizations must disable or restrict unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports/protocols/services on information systems.<br><br>Applications are capable of providing a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and services provided by default may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations. Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from a single component (e.g., email and web services); however, doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by any one component. <br><br>To support the requirements and principles of least functionality, the application must support the organizational requirements providing only essential capabilities and limiting the use of ports, protocols, and/or services to only those required, authorized, and approved to conduct official business or to address authorized quality of life issues.<br><br>Database Management Systems (DBMSs) using ports, protocols, and services deemed unsafe are open to attack through those ports, protocols, and services. This can allow unauthorized access to the database and through the database to other components of the information system. |  |  |  |  |  |
| V-235147 | medium | The MySQL Database Server 8.0 must uniquely identify and authenticate organizational users (or processes acting on behalf of organizational users). | To ensure accountability and prevent unauthenticated access, organizational users must be identified and authenticated to prevent potential misuse and compromise of the system. <br><br>Organizational users include organizational employees or individuals the organization deems to have equivalent status of employees (e.g., contractors). Organizational users (and any processes acting on behalf of users) must be uniquely identified and authenticated for all accesses, except the following:<br><br>(i) Accesses explicitly identified and documented by the organization. Organizations document specific user actions that can be performed on the information system without identification or authentication; and <br>(ii) Accesses that occur through authorized use of group authenticators without individual authentication. Organizations may require unique identification of individuals in group accounts (e.g., shared privilege accounts) or for detailed accountability of individual activity. |  |  |  |  |  |
| V-235096 | medium | MySQL Database Server 8.0  must limit the number of concurrent sessions to an organization-defined number per user for all accounts and/or account types. | Database management includes the ability to control the number of users and user sessions utilizing a Database Management System (DBMS). Unlimited concurrent connections to the DBMS could allow a successful Denial of Service (DoS) attack by exhausting connection resources; and a system can also fail or be degraded by an overload of legitimate users. Limiting the number of concurrent sessions per user is helpful in reducing these risks.<br><br>This requirement addresses concurrent session control for a single account. It does not address concurrent sessions by a single user via multiple system accounts; and it does not deal with the total number of sessions across all accounts.<br><br>The capability to limit the number of concurrent sessions per user must be configured in or added to the DBMS (for example, by use of a logon trigger), when this is technically feasible. Note that it is not sufficient to limit sessions via a web server or application server alone, because legitimate users and adversaries can potentially connect to the DBMS by other means.<br><br>The organization will need to define the maximum number of concurrent sessions by account type, by account, or a combination thereof.  In deciding on the appropriate number, it is important to consider the work requirements of the various types of users. For example, 2 might be an acceptable limit for general users accessing the database via an application; but 10 might be too few for a database administrator using a database management GUI tool, where each query tab and navigation pane may count as a separate session.<br><br>(Sessions may also be referred to as connections or logons, which for the purposes of this requirement, are synonyms.) |  |  |  |  |  |
| V-235097 | medium | MySQL Database Server 8.0  must produce audit records containing sufficient information to establish what type of events occurred. | Information system auditing capability is critical for accurate forensic analysis. Without establishing what type of event occurred, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one. <br><br>Audit record content that may be necessary to satisfy the requirement of this policy includes, for example, time stamps, user/process identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, filenames involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked.<br><br>Associating event types with detected events in the application and audit logs provides a means of investigating an attack; recognizing resource utilization or capacity thresholds; or identifying an improperly configured application. <br><br>Database software is capable of a range of actions on data stored within the database. It is important, for accurate forensic analysis, to know exactly what actions were performed. This requires specific information regarding the event type to which an audit record refers. If event type information is not recorded and stored with the audit record, the record itself is of very limited use.<br><br>MySQL provides auditing using the MySQL Enterprise Audit Log Plugin. When installed, the audit plugin enables MySQL Server to produce a log file containing an audit record of server activity. The log contents include when clients connect and disconnect, and what actions they perform while connected, such as which databases and tables they access. |  |  |  |  |  |
| V-235095 | high | MySQL Database Server 8.0 must integrate with an organization-level authentication/access mechanism providing account management and automation for all users, groups, roles, and any other principals. | Enterprise environments make account management for applications and databases challenging and complex. A manual process for account management functions adds the risk of a potential oversight or other error. Managing accounts for the same person in multiple places is inefficient and prone to problems with consistency and synchronization.<br><br>A comprehensive application account management process that includes automation helps to ensure accounts designated as requiring attention are consistently and promptly addressed. <br><br>Examples include, but are not limited to, using automation to take action on multiple accounts designated as inactive, suspended, or terminated, or by disabling accounts located in non-centralized account stores, such as multiple servers.  Account management functions can also include: assignment of group or role membership; identifying account type; specifying user access authorizations (i.e., privileges); account removal, update, or termination; and administrative alerts. The use of automated mechanisms can include, for example: using email or text messaging to notify account managers when users are terminated or transferred; using the information system to monitor account usage; and using automated telephone notification to report atypical system account usage.<br><br>The DBMS must be configured to automatically utilize organization-level account management functions, and these functions must immediately enforce the organization's current account policy. <br><br>Automation may be comprised of differing technologies that when placed together contain an overall mechanism supporting an organization's automated account management requirements. |  |  |  |  |  |
| V-235098 | medium | The MySQL Database Server 8.0 must include additional, more detailed, organizationally defined information in the audit records for audit events identified by type, location, or subject. | Information system auditing capability is critical for accurate forensic analysis. Reconstruction of harmful events or forensic analysis is not possible if audit records do not contain enough information. To support analysis, some types of events will need information to be logged that exceeds the basic requirements of event type, time stamps, location, source, outcome, and user identity. If additional information is not available, it could negatively impact forensic investigations into user actions or other malicious events.<br><br>The organization must determine what additional information is required for complete analysis of the audited events. The additional information required is dependent on the type of information (e.g., sensitivity of the data and the environment within which it resides). At a minimum, the organization must employ either full-text recording of privileged commands or the individual identities of group users, or both. The organization must maintain audit trails in sufficient detail to reconstruct events to determine the cause and impact of compromise. <br><br>Examples of detailed information the organization may require in audit records are full-text recording of privileged commands or the individual identities of group account users. |  |  |  |  |  |
| V-235099 | medium | The audit information produced by the MySQL Database Server 8.0 must be protected from unauthorized read access. | If audit data were to become compromised, then competent forensic analysis and discovery of the true source of potentially malicious system activity is difficult, if not impossible, to achieve. In addition, access to audit records provides information an attacker could potentially use to their advantage.<br><br>To ensure the veracity of audit data, the information system and/or the application must protect audit information from any and all unauthorized access. This includes read, write, copy, etc.<br><br>This requirement can be achieved through multiple methods, which will depend upon system architecture and design. Some commonly employed methods include ensuring log files enjoy the proper file system permissions utilizing file system protections and limiting log data location. <br><br>Additionally, applications with user interfaces to audit records should not allow for the unfettered manipulation of or access to those records via the application. If the application provides access to the audit data, the application becomes accountable for ensuring that audit information is protected from unauthorized access.<br><br>Audit information includes all information (e.g., audit records, audit settings, and audit reports) needed to successfully audit information system activity.<br><br>If the value of audit_log_file is a relative path name, the plugin interprets it relative to the data directory. If the value is a full path name, the plugin uses the value as is. A full path name may be useful if it is desirable to locate audit files on a separate file system or directory. For security reasons, write the audit log file to a directory accessible only to the MySQL server and to users with a legitimate reason to view the log. |  |  |  |  |  |
| V-235159 | medium | The MySQL Database Server 8.0 must initiate session auditing upon startup. | Session auditing is for use when a user's activities are under investigation. To be sure of capturing all activity during those periods when session auditing is in use, it needs to be in operation for the whole time the Database Management System (DBMS) is running. |  |  |  |  |  |
| V-235158 | medium | The MySQL Database Server 8.0 and associated applications, when making use of dynamic code execution, must scan input data for invalid values that may indicate a code injection attack. | With respect to database management systems, one class of threat is known as SQL Injection, or more generally, code injection. It takes advantage of the dynamic execution capabilities of various programming languages, including dialects of SQL. In such cases, the attacker deduces the manner in which SQL statements are being processed, either from inside knowledge or by observing system behavior in response to invalid inputs. When the attacker identifies scenarios where SQL queries are being assembled by application code (which may be within the database or separate from it) and executed dynamically, the attacker is then able to craft input strings that subvert the intent of the query. Potentially, the attacker can gain unauthorized access to data, including security settings, and severely corrupt or destroy the database.<br><br>The principal protection against code injection is not to use dynamic execution except where it provides necessary functionality that cannot be utilized otherwise. Use strongly typed data items rather than general-purpose strings as input parameters to task-specific, pre-compiled stored procedures and functions (and triggers).<br><br>When dynamic execution is necessary, ways to mitigate the risk include the following, which should be implemented both in the on-screen application and at the database level, in the stored procedures:<br>-- Allow strings as input only when necessary. <br>-- Rely on data typing to validate numbers, dates, etc. Do not accept invalid values. If substituting other values for them, think carefully about whether this could be subverted.<br>-- Limit the size of input strings to what is truly necessary.<br>-- If single quotes/apostrophes, double quotes, semicolons, equal signs, angle brackets, or square brackets will never be valid as input, reject them.<br>-- If comment markers will never be valid as input, reject them. In SQL, these are -- or /*  */ <br>-- If HTML and XML tags, entities, comments, etc., will never be valid, reject them.<br>-- If wildcards are present, reject them unless truly necessary. In SQL these are the underscore and the percentage sign, and the word "ESCAPE" is also a clue that wildcards are in use.<br>-- If SQL key words, such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, ALTER, DROP, ESCAPE, UNION, GRANT, REVOKE, DENY, MODIFY will never be valid, reject them. Use case-insensitive comparisons when    searching for these. Bear in mind that some of these words, particularly Grant (as a person's name), could also be valid input. <br>-- If there are range limits on the values that may be entered, enforce those limits.<br>-- Institute procedures for inspection of programs for correct use of dynamic coding, by a party other than the developer.<br>-- Conduct rigorous testing of program modules that use dynamic coding, searching for ways to subvert the intended use.<br>-- Record the inspection and testing in the system documentation.<br>-- Bear in mind that all this applies not only to screen input, but also to the values in an incoming message to a web service or to a stored procedure called by a software component that has not itself been hardened in these ways. Not only can the caller be subject to such vulnerabilities; it may itself be the attacker.<br><br>The MySQL Firewall runs within the MySQL server and enables database administrators to permit or deny SQL statement execution based on matching against whitelists of accepted statement patterns. This hardens MySQL Server against attacks such as SQL injection or attempts to exploit applications by using them outside of their legitimate query workload characteristics. |  |  |  |  |  |
| V-235153 | medium | Access to database files must be limited to relevant processes and to authorized, administrative users. | Applications, including DBMSs, must prevent unauthorized and unintended information transfer via shared system resources. Permitting only DBMS processes and authorized, administrative users to have access to the files where the database resides helps ensure that those files are not shared inappropriately and are not open to backdoor access and manipulation.<br><br>As a general rule, distributed files and resources should follow the principal of least privilege, which requires that users, processes, programs, and other system components only have access to information and resources required for their legitimate purpose. |  |  |  |  |  |
| V-235152 | medium | Database contents must be protected from unauthorized and unintended information transfer by enforcement of a data-transfer policy. | Applications, including DBMSs, must prevent unauthorized and unintended information transfer via shared system resources. <br><br>Data used for the development and testing of applications often involves copying data from production. It is important that specific procedures exist for this process, to include the conditions under which such transfer may take place, where the copies may reside, and the rules for ensuring sensitive data are not exposed.<br><br>Copies of sensitive data must not be misplaced or left in a temporary location without the proper controls. |  |  |  |  |  |
| V-235151 | medium | The MySQL Database Server 8.0 must isolate security functions from non-security functions. | An isolation boundary provides access control and protects the integrity of the hardware, software, and firmware that perform security functions. <br><br>Security functions are the hardware, software, and/or firmware of the information system responsible for enforcing the system security policy and supporting the isolation of code and data on which the protection is based.<br><br>Developers and implementers can increase the assurance in security functions by employing well-defined security policy models; structured, disciplined, and rigorous hardware and software development techniques; and sound system/security engineering principles. <br><br>Database Management Systems typically separate security functionality from non-security functionality via separate databases or schemas. Database objects or code implementing security functionality should not be commingled with objects or code implementing application logic. When security and non-security functionality are commingled, users who have access to non-security functionality may be able to access security functionality.<br><br>The mysql database is the system database. It contains tables that store information required by the MySQL server as it runs.<br><br>The INFORMATION_SCHEMA provides access to database metadata, information about the MySQL server such as the name of a database or table, the data type of a column, or access privileges. Other terms sometimes used for this information are data dictionary and system catalog.<br><br>The MySQL Performance Schema is a feature for monitoring MySQL Server execution at a low level. The Performance Schema has these characteristics: The Performance Schema provides a way to inspect internal execution of the server at runtime. It is implemented using the PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA storage engine and the performance_schema database. The PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA storage engine collects event data using “instrumentation points” in server source code. Tables in the Performance Schema are in-memory tables that use no persistent on-disk storage.<br><br>MySQL 8.0 includes the sys schema, a set of objects that helps DBAs and developers interpret data collected by the Performance Schema. The sys schema objects can be used for typical tuning and diagnosis use cases. |  |  |  |  |  |
| V-235150 | medium | The MySQL Database Server 8.0 must separate user functionality (including user interface services) from database management functionality. | Information system management functionality includes functions necessary to administer databases, network components, workstations, or servers, and typically requires privileged user access. <br><br>The separation of user functionality from information system management functionality is either physical or logical and is accomplished by using different computers, different central processing units, different instances of the operating system, different network addresses, combinations of these methods, or other methods, as appropriate. <br><br>An example of this type of separation is observed in web administrative interfaces that use separate authentication methods for users of any other information system resources. <br><br>This may include isolating the administrative interface on a different domain and with additional access controls.<br><br>If administrative functionality or information regarding DBMS management is presented on an interface available for users, information on DBMS settings may be inadvertently made available to the user. |  |  |  |  |  |
| V-235157 | medium | The MySQL Database Server 8.0 and associated applications must reserve the use of dynamic code execution for situations that require it. | With respect to database management systems, one class of threat is known as SQL Injection, or more generally, code injection. It takes advantage of the dynamic execution capabilities of various programming languages, including dialects of SQL. In such cases, the attacker deduces the manner in which SQL statements are being processed, either from inside knowledge or by observing system behavior in response to invalid inputs. When the attacker identifies scenarios where SQL queries are being assembled by application code (which may be within the database or separate from it) and executed dynamically, the attacker is then able to craft input strings that subvert the intent of the query. Potentially, the attacker can gain unauthorized access to data, including security settings, and severely corrupt or destroy the database.<br><br>The principal protection against code injection is not to use dynamic execution except where it provides necessary functionality that cannot be utilized otherwise. Use strongly typed data items rather than general-purpose strings as input parameters to task-specific, pre-compiled stored procedures and functions (and triggers). |  |  |  |  |  |
| V-235156 | medium | The MySQL Database Server 8.0 must check the validity of all data inputs except those specifically identified by the organization. | Invalid user input occurs when a user inserts data or characters into an application's data entry fields and the application is unprepared to process that data. This results in unanticipated application behavior, potentially leading to an application or information system compromise. Invalid user input is one of the primary methods employed when attempting to compromise an application.<br><br>With respect to database management systems, one class of threat is known as SQL Injection, or more generally, code injection. It takes advantage of the dynamic execution capabilities of various programming languages, including dialects of SQL. Potentially, the attacker can gain unauthorized access to data, including security settings, and severely corrupt or destroy the database.<br><br>Even when no such hijacking takes place, invalid input that gets recorded in the database, whether accidental or malicious, reduces the reliability and usability of the system. Available protections include data types, referential constraints, uniqueness constraints, range checking, and application-specific logic. Application-specific logic can be implemented within the database in stored procedures and triggers, where appropriate. |  |  |  |  |  |
| V-235155 | high | The MySQL Database Server 8.0 must protect the confidentiality and integrity of all information at rest. | This control is intended to address the confidentiality and integrity of information at rest in non-mobile devices and covers user information and system information. Information at rest refers to the state of information when it is located on a secondary storage device (e.g., disk drive, tape drive) within an organizational information system. Applications and application users generate information throughout the course of their application use. <br><br>User data generated, as well as application-specific configuration data, needs to be protected. Organizations may choose to employ different mechanisms to achieve confidentiality and integrity protections, as appropriate. <br><br>If the confidentiality and integrity of application data is not protected, the data will be open to compromise and unauthorized modification. |  |  |  |  |  |
| V-235154 | medium | The MySQL Database Server 8.0 must maintain the authenticity of communications sessions by guarding against man-in-the-middle attacks that guess at Session ID values. | One class of man-in-the-middle, or session hijacking, attack involves the adversary guessing at valid session identifiers based on patterns in identifiers already known.<br><br>The preferred technique for thwarting guesses at Session IDs is the generation of unique session identifiers using a FIPS 140-2 or 140-3 approved random number generator.<br><br>However, it is recognized that available DBMS products do not all implement the preferred technique yet may have other protections against session hijacking. Therefore, other techniques are acceptable, provided they are demonstrated to be effective. |  |  |  |  |  |
| V-235168 | medium | The MySQL Database Server 8.0 must prohibit user installation of logic modules (stored procedures, functions, triggers, views, etc.) without explicit privileged status. | Allowing regular users to install software, without explicit privileges, creates the risk that untested or potentially malicious software will be installed on the system. Explicit privileges (escalated or administrative privileges) provide the regular user with explicit capabilities and control that exceed the rights of a regular user.<br><br>Database Management System (DBMS) functionality and the nature and requirements of databases will vary; so while users are not permitted to install unapproved software, there may be instances where the organization allows the user to install approved software packages such as from an approved software repository. The requirements for production servers will be more restrictive than those used for development and research.<br><br>The DBMS must enforce software installation by users based upon what types of software installations are permitted (e.g., updates and security patches to existing software) and what types of installations are prohibited (e.g., software whose pedigree with regard to being potentially malicious is unknown or suspect) by the organization. <br><br>In the case of a DBMS, this requirement covers stored procedures, functions, triggers, views, etc. |  |  |  |  |  |
| V-235169 | medium | The MySQL Database Server 8.0 must enforce access restrictions associated with changes to the configuration of the MySQL Database Server 8.0 or database(s). | Failure to provide logical access restrictions associated with changes to configuration may have significant effects on the overall security of the system. <br><br>When dealing with access restrictions pertaining to change control, it should be noted that any changes to the hardware, software, and/or firmware components of the information system can potentially have significant effects on the overall security of the system. <br><br>Accordingly, only qualified and authorized individuals should be allowed to obtain access to system components for the purposes of initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications. |  |  |  |  |  |

| V-235167 | medium | The MySQL Database Server 8.0 must disable network functions, ports, protocols, and services deemed by the organization to be nonsecure, in accord with the Ports, Protocols, and Services Management (PPSM) guidance. | Use of nonsecure network functions, ports, protocols, and services exposes the system to avoidable threats. |  |  |  |  |  |
| V-235164 | medium | The MySQL Database Server 8.0 software installation account must be restricted to authorized users. | When dealing with change control issues, it must be noted any changes to the hardware, software, and/or firmware components of the information system and/or application can have significant effects on the overall security of the system. <br><br>If the system were to allow any user to make changes to software libraries, those changes might be implemented without undergoing the appropriate testing and approvals that are part of a robust change management process.<br><br>Accordingly, only qualified and authorized individuals must be allowed access to information system components for purposes of initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications.<br><br>DBA and other privileged administrative or application owner accounts are granted privileges that allow actions that can have a great impact on database security and operation. It is especially important to grant privileged access to only those persons who are qualified and authorized to use them. |  |  |  |  |  |
| V-235165 | medium | Database software, including MySQL Database Server 8.0 configuration files, must be stored in dedicated directories, or DASD pools (remove), separate from the host OS and other applications. | When dealing with change control issues, it should be noted any changes to the hardware, software, and/or firmware components of the information system and/or application can potentially have significant effects on the overall security of the system. <br><br>Multiple applications can provide a cumulative negative effect. A vulnerability and subsequent exploit to one application can lead to an exploit of other applications sharing the same security context. For example, an exploit to a web server process that leads to unauthorized administrative access to host system directories can most likely lead to a compromise of all applications hosted by the same system. Database software not installed using dedicated directories both threatens and is threatened by other hosted applications. Access controls defined for one application may by default provide access to the other application's database objects or directories. Any method that provides any level of separation of security context assists in the protection between applications. |  |  |  |  |  |
| V-235162 | medium | The MySQL Database Server 8.0 must protect its audit features from unauthorized removal. | Protecting audit data also includes identifying and protecting the tools used to view and manipulate log data. Therefore, protecting audit tools is necessary to prevent unauthorized operation on audit data.<br><br>Applications providing tools to interface with audit data will leverage user permissions and roles identifying the user accessing the tools and the corresponding rights the user enjoys in order make access decisions regarding the deletion of audit tools.<br><br>Audit tools include, but are not limited to, vendor-provided and open source audit tools needed to successfully view and manipulate audit information system activity and records. Audit tools include custom queries and report generators. |  |  |  |  |  |
| V-235163 | medium | The MySQL Database Server 8.0 must limit privileges to change software modules, to include stored procedures, functions and triggers, and links to software external to the MySQL Database Server 8.0. | If the system were to allow any user to make changes to software libraries, then those changes might be implemented without undergoing the appropriate testing and approvals that are part of a robust change management process.<br><br>Accordingly, only qualified and authorized individuals will be allowed to obtain access to information system components for purposes of initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications.<br><br>Unmanaged changes that occur to the database software libraries or configuration can lead to unauthorized or compromised installations. |  |  |  |  |  |
| V-235160 | medium | The MySQL Database Server 8.0 must protect its audit features from unauthorized access. | Protecting audit data also includes identifying and protecting the tools used to view and manipulate log data. <br><br>Depending upon the log format and application, system and application log tools may provide the only means to manipulate and manage application and system log data. It is, therefore, imperative that access to audit tools be controlled and protected from unauthorized access. <br><br>Applications providing tools to interface with audit data will leverage user permissions and roles identifying the user accessing the tools and the corresponding rights the user enjoys to make access decisions regarding the access to audit tools.<br><br>Audit tools include, but are not limited to, OS-provided audit tools, vendor-provided audit tools, and open source audit tools needed to successfully view and manipulate audit information system activity and records. <br><br>If an attacker were to gain access to audit tools, he could analyze audit logs for system weaknesses or weaknesses in the auditing itself. An attacker could also manipulate logs to hide evidence of malicious activity. |  |  |  |  |  |
| V-235161 | medium | The MySQL Database Server 8.0 must protect its audit configuration from unauthorized modification. | Protecting audit data also includes identifying and protecting the tools used to view and manipulate log data. Therefore, protecting audit tools is necessary to prevent unauthorized operation on audit data.<br><br>Applications providing tools to interface with audit data will leverage user permissions and roles identifying the user accessing the tools and the corresponding rights the user enjoys in order make access decisions regarding the modification of audit tools.<br><br>Audit tools include, but are not limited to, vendor-provided and open source audit tools needed to successfully view and manipulate audit information system activity and records. Audit tools include custom queries and report generators. |  |  |  |  |  |
| V-235171 | medium | The MySQL Database Server 8.0 must utilize centralized management of the content captured in audit records generated by all components of the MySQL Database Server 8.0. | The content captured in audit records must be managed from a central location (necessitating automation). Centralized management of audit records and logs provides for efficiency in maintenance and management of records, as well as the backup and archiving of those records. <br><br>The MySQL Server writes audit records to files in the file system and this data is available via ReadOnly using functions within the MySQL Server. These files are available via SQL functions or on the filesystem in JSON and XML formats providing compatibility for off-loading audit records to centralized system(s). |  |  |  |  |  |
| V-235170 | medium | The MySQL Database Server 8.0 must produce audit records of its enforcement of access restrictions associated with changes to the configuration of the MySQL Database Server 8.0 or database(s). | Without auditing the enforcement of access restrictions against changes to configuration, it would be difficult to identify attempted attacks and an audit trail would not be available for forensic investigation for after-the-fact actions. <br><br>Enforcement actions are the methods or mechanisms used to prevent unauthorized changes to configuration settings. Enforcement action methods may be as simple as denying access to a file based on the application of file permissions (access restriction). Audit items may consist of lists of actions blocked by access restrictions or changes identified after the fact. |  |  |  |  |  |
| V-235173 | medium | The MySQL Database Server 8.0 must allocate audit record storage capacity in accordance with organization-defined audit record storage requirements. | To ensure sufficient storage capacity for the audit logs, the Database Management System (DBMS) must be able to allocate audit record storage capacity. Although another requirement (SRG-APP-000515-DB-000318) mandates that audit data be off-loaded to a centralized log management system, it remains necessary to provide space on the database server to serve as a buffer against outages and capacity limits of the off-loading mechanism.<br><br>The task of allocating audit record storage capacity is usually performed during initial installation of the DBMS and is closely associated with the DBA and system administrator roles. The DBA or system administrator will usually coordinate the allocation of physical drive space with the application owner/installer and the application will prompt the installer to provide the capacity information, the physical location of the disk, or both.<br><br>In determining the capacity requirements, consider such factors as: total number of users; expected number of concurrent users during busy periods; number and type of events being monitored; types and amounts of data being captured; the frequency/speed with which audit records are off-loaded to the central log management system; and any limitations that exist on the DBMS's ability to reuse the space formerly occupied by off-loaded records. |  |  |  |  |  |
| V-235172 | medium | The MySQL Database Server 8.0 must provide centralized configuration of the content to be captured in audit records generated by all components of the MySQL Database Server 8.0. | If the configuration of the Database Management System's (DBMS's) auditing is spread across multiple locations in the database management software, or across multiple commands, only loosely related, it is harder to use and takes longer to reconfigure in response to events.<br><br>The DBMS must provide a unified tool for audit configuration. |  |  |  |  |  |
| V-235175 | medium | The MySQL Database Server 8.0 must provide a warning to appropriate support staff when allocated audit record storage volume reaches 75 percent of maximum audit record storage capacity. | Organizations are required to use a central log management system, so, under normal conditions, the audit space allocated to the DBMS on its own server will not be an issue. However, space will still be required on the Database Management System's (DBMS) server for audit records in transit, and, under abnormal conditions, this could fill up. Since a requirement exists to halt processing upon audit failure, a service outage would result.<br><br>If support personnel are not notified immediately upon storage volume utilization reaching 75 percent, they are unable to plan for storage capacity expansion. <br><br>The appropriate support staff include, at a minimum, the Information System Security Officer (ISSO) and the database administrator (DBA)/system administrator (SA). |  |  |  |  |  |
| V-235174 | medium | The MySQL Database Server 8.0 must off-load audit data to a separate log management facility; this must be continuous and in near real time for systems with a network connection to the storage facility and weekly or more often for stand-alone systems. | Information stored in one location is vulnerable to accidental or incidental deletion or alteration.<br><br>Off-loading is a common process in information systems with limited audit storage capacity. <br><br>The DBMS may write audit records to database tables, to files in the file system, to other kinds of local repository, or directly to a centralized log management system. Whatever the method used, it must be compatible with off-loading the records to the centralized system. |  |  |  |  |  |
| V-235177 | medium | The MySQL Database Server 8.0 must prohibit the use of cached authenticators after an organization-defined time period. | If cached authentication information is out-of-date, the validity of the authentication information may be questionable. |  |  |  |  |  |
| V-235176 | medium | The MySQL Database Server 8.0 must provide an immediate real-time alert to appropriate support staff of all audit log failures. | It is critical for the appropriate personnel to be aware if a system is at risk of failing to process audit logs as required. Without a real-time alert, security personnel may be unaware of an impending failure of the audit capability, and system operation may be adversely affected. <br><br>The appropriate support staff include, at a minimum, the Information System Security Officer (ISSO) and the database administrator (DBA)/system administrator (SA).<br><br>A failure of database auditing will result in either the database continuing to function without auditing or in a complete halt to database operations. When audit processing fails, appropriate personnel must be alerted immediately to avoid further downtime or unaudited transactions.<br><br>Alerts provide organizations with urgent messages. Real-time alerts provide these messages immediately (i.e., the time from event detection to alert occurs in seconds or less). |  |  |  |  |  |
| V-235179 | medium | The MySQL Database Server 8.0 must enforce discretionary access control policies, as defined by the data owner, over defined subjects and objects. | Discretionary Access Control (DAC) is based on the notion that individual users are "owners" of objects and therefore have discretion over who should be authorized to access the object and in which mode (e.g., read or write). Ownership is usually acquired as a consequence of creating the object or via specified ownership assignment. DAC allows the owner to determine who will have access to objects they control. An example of DAC includes user-controlled table permissions.<br><br>When discretionary access control policies are implemented, subjects are not constrained with regard to what actions they can take with information for which they have already been granted access. Thus, subjects that have been granted access to information are not prevented from passing (i.e., the subjects have the discretion to pass) the information to other subjects or objects. <br><br>A subject that is constrained in its operation by Mandatory Access Control policies is still able to operate under the less rigorous constraints of this requirement. Thus, while Mandatory Access Control imposes constraints preventing a subject from passing information to another subject operating at a different sensitivity level, this requirement permits the subject to pass the information to any subject at the same sensitivity level. <br><br>The policy is bounded by the information system boundary. Once the information is passed outside of the control of the information system, additional means may be required to ensure the constraints remain in effect. While the older, more traditional definitions of discretionary access control require identity-based access control, that limitation is not required for this use of discretionary access control. |  |  |  |  |  |
| V-235178 | medium | The MySQL Database Server 8.0 must require users to reauthenticate when organization-defined circumstances or situations require reauthentication. | The DoD standard for authentication of an interactive user is the presentation of a Common Access Card (CAC) or other physical token bearing a valid, current, DoD-issued Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificate, coupled with a Personal Identification Number (PIN) to be entered by the user at the beginning of each session and whenever reauthentication is required.<br><br>Without reauthentication, users may access resources or perform tasks for which they do not have authorization. <br><br>When applications provide the capability to change security roles or escalate the functional capability of the application, it is critical the user reauthenticate.<br><br>In addition to the reauthentication requirements associated with session locks, organizations may require reauthentication of individuals and/or devices in other situations, including (but not limited to) the following circumstances:<br><br>(i) When authenticators change; <br>(ii) When roles change; <br>(iii) When security categories of information systems change; <br>(iv) When the execution of privileged functions occurs; <br>(v) After a fixed period of time; or<br>(vi) Periodically.<br><br>Within the DoD, the minimum circumstances requiring reauthentication are privilege escalation and role changes. |  |  |  |  |  |
| V-235188 | medium | The MySQL Database Server 8.0 must implement NIST FIPS 140-2 or 140-3 validated cryptographic modules to provision digital signatures. | Use of weak or untested encryption algorithms undermines the purposes of utilizing encryption to protect data. The application must implement cryptographic modules adhering to the higher standards approved by the federal government since this provides assurance they have been tested and validated.<br><br>For detailed information, refer to NIST FIPS Publication 140-2 or Publication 140-3, Security Requirements For Cryptographic Modules.  Note that the product's cryptographic modules must be validated and certified by NIST as FIPS-compliant. |  |  |  |  |  |

| V-235184 | medium | The MySQL Database Server 8.0 must associate organization-defined types of security labels having organization-defined security label values with information in transmission. | Without the association of security labels to information, there is no basis for the DBMS to make security-related access-control decisions.<br><br>Security labels are abstractions representing the basic properties or characteristics of an entity (e.g., subjects and objects) with respect to safeguarding information. <br><br>These labels are typically associated with internal data structures (e.g., tables, rows) within the database and are used to enable the implementation of access control and flow control policies, reflect special dissemination, handling or distribution instructions, or support other aspects of the information security policy. <br><br>One example includes marking data as classified or FOUO. These security labels may be assigned manually or during data processing, but, either way, it is imperative these assignments are maintained while the data is in storage. If the security labels are lost when the data is stored, there is the risk of a data compromise.<br><br>The mechanism used to support security labeling may be a feature of the DBMS product, a third-party product, or custom application code.<br><br>For MySQL, a view or stored procedures can limit access to only selected columns of the base table. A view can provide value-based security for the information in a table. To use a view requires appropriate privileges only for the view itself. The user need not be given privileges on base objects underlying the view. |  |  |  |  |  |
| V-235185 | medium | The MySQL Database Server 8.0 must automatically terminate a user session after organization-defined conditions or trigger events requiring session disconnect. | This addresses the termination of user-initiated logical sessions in contrast to the termination of network connections associated with communications sessions (i.e., network disconnect). A logical session (for local, network, and remote access) is initiated whenever a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) accesses an organizational information system. Such user sessions can be terminated (and thus terminate user access) without terminating network sessions. <br><br>Session termination ends all processes associated with a user's logical session except those batch processes/jobs that are specifically created by the user (i.e., session owner) to continue after the session is terminated. <br><br>Conditions or trigger events requiring automatic session termination can include, for example, organization-defined periods of user inactivity, targeted responses to certain types of incidents, and time-of-day restrictions on information system use.<br><br>This capability is typically reserved for specific cases where the system owner, data owner, or organization requires additional assurance.<br><br>Each connection to mysqld runs in a separate thread. Kill a connection by killing the connections thread with the KILL processlist_id statement.<br><br>Thread processlist identifiers can be determined from the ID column of the INFORMATION_SCHEMA PROCESSLIST table, the Id column of SHOW PROCESSLIST output, and the PROCESSLIST_ID column of the Performance Schema threads table. |  |  |  |  |  |
| V-235186 | medium | The MySQL Database Server 8.0 must maintain the confidentiality and integrity of information during preparation for transmission. | Information can be either unintentionally or maliciously disclosed or modified during preparation for transmission, including, for example, during aggregation, at protocol transformation points, and during packing/unpacking. These unauthorized disclosures or modifications compromise the confidentiality or integrity of the information.<br><br>Use of this requirement will be limited to situations where the data owner has a strict requirement for ensuring data integrity and confidentiality is maintained at every step of the data transfer and handling process. <br><br>When transmitting data, the DBMS, associated applications, and infrastructure must leverage transmission protection mechanisms. |  |  |  |  |  |
| V-235187 | medium | The MySQL Database Server 8.0 must use NSA-approved cryptography to protect classified information in accordance with the data owner's requirements. | Use of weak or untested encryption algorithms undermines the purposes of utilizing encryption to protect data. The application must implement cryptographic modules adhering to the higher standards approved by the federal government since this provides assurance they have been tested and validated.<br><br>It is the responsibility of the data owner to assess the cryptography requirements in light of applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, and standards.<br><br>NSA-approved cryptography for classified networks is hardware based. This requirement addresses the compatibility of a DBMS with the encryption devices. |  |  |  |  |  |
| V-235180 | medium | Execution of software modules (to include stored procedures, functions, and triggers) with elevated privileges must be restricted to necessary cases only. | In certain situations, to provide required functionality, a Database Management System (DBMS) needs to execute internal logic (stored procedures, functions, triggers, etc.) and/or external code modules with elevated privileges. However, if the privileges required for execution are at a higher level than the privileges assigned to organizational users invoking the functionality applications/programs, those users are indirectly provided with greater privileges than assigned by organizations.<br><br>Privilege elevation must be utilized only where necessary and protected from misuse. |  |  |  |  |  |
| V-235181 | medium | The MySQL Database Server 8.0 must prevent non-privileged users from executing privileged functions, to include disabling, circumventing, or altering implemented security safeguards/countermeasures. | Preventing non-privileged users from executing privileged functions mitigates the risk that unauthorized individuals or processes may gain unnecessary access to information or privileges. <br><br>System documentation should include a definition of the functionality considered privileged.<br><br>Depending on circumstances, privileged functions can include, for example, establishing accounts, performing system integrity checks, or administering cryptographic key management activities. Non-privileged users are individuals that do not possess appropriate authorizations. Circumventing intrusion detection and prevention mechanisms or malicious code protection mechanisms are examples of privileged functions that require protection from non-privileged users.<br><br>A privileged function in the Database Management System (DBMS)/database context is any operation that modifies the structure of the database, its built-in logic, or its security settings. This would include all Data Definition Language (DDL) statements and all security-related statements. In a SQL environment, it encompasses, but is not necessarily limited to: <br>CREATE<br>ALTER<br>DROP<br>GRANT<br>REVOKE<br>DENY<br><br>There may also be Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements that, subject to context, should be regarded as privileged.

| V-235195 | medium | When invalid inputs are received, the MySQL Database Server 8.0 must behave in a predictable and documented manner that reflects organizational and system objectives. | A common vulnerability is unplanned behavior when invalid inputs are received. This requirement guards against adverse or unintended system behavior caused by invalid inputs, where information system responses to the invalid input may be disruptive or cause the system to fail into an unsafe state.<br><br>The behavior will be derived from the organizational and system requirements and includes, but is not limited to, notification of the appropriate personnel, creating an audit record, and rejecting invalid input.<br><br>This calls for inspection of application source code, which will require collaboration with the application developers. It is recognized that in many cases, the database administrator (DBA) is organizationally separate from the application developers, and may have limited, if any, access to source code. Nevertheless, protections of this type are so important to the secure operation of databases that they must not be ignored. At a minimum, the DBA must attempt to obtain assurances from the development organization that this issue has been addressed, and must document what has been discovered. |  |  |  |  |  |
| V-235194 | medium | Security-relevant software updates to the MySQL Database Server 8.0 must be installed within the time period directed by an authoritative source (e.g., IAVM, CTOs, DTMs, and STIGs). | Security flaws with software applications, including database management systems, are discovered daily. Vendors are constantly updating and patching their products to address newly discovered security vulnerabilities. Organizations (including any contractor to the organization) are required to promptly install security-relevant software updates (e.g., patches, service packs, and hot fixes). Flaws discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, or information system error handling must also be addressed expeditiously. <br><br>Organization-defined time periods for updating security-relevant software may vary based on a variety of factors including, for example, the security category of the information system or the criticality of the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw). <br><br>This requirement will apply to software patch management solutions that are used to install patches across the enclave and also to applications themselves that are not part of that patch management solution. For example, many browsers today provide the capability to install their own patch software. Patch criticality, as well as system criticality, will vary. Therefore, the tactical situations regarding the patch management process will also vary. This means that the time period utilized must be a configurable parameter. Time frames for application of security-relevant software updates may be dependent upon the Information Assurance Vulnerability Management (IAVM) process.<br><br>The application will be configured to check for and install security-relevant software updates within an identified time period from the availability of the update. The specific time period will be defined by an authoritative source (e.g., IAVM, CTOs, DTMs, and STIGs). |  |  |  |  |  |

Therefore, the use of plain-text passwords must be prohibited as a matter of practice and procedure. |  |  |  |  |  |
| V-235135 | high | The MySQL Database Server 8.0 must enforce authorized access to all PKI private keys stored/utilized by the MySQL Database Server 8.0. | The DoD standard for authentication is DoD-approved PKI certificates. PKI certificate-based authentication is performed by requiring the certificate holder to cryptographically prove possession of the corresponding private key.<br><br>If the private key is stolen, an attacker can use it to impersonate the certificate holder.

Certification path validation is necessary for a relying party to make an informed decision regarding acceptance of an end entity certificate. Certification path validation includes checks such as certificate issuer trust, time validity, and revocation status for each certificate in the certification path. Revocation status information for CA and subject certificates in a certification path is commonly provided via certificate revocation lists (CRLs) or online certificate status protocol (OCSP) responses.<br><br>Database Management Systems that do not validate certificates by performing RFC 5280-compliant certification path validation are in danger of accepting certificates that are invalid and/or counterfeit.
