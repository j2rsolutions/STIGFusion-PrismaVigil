# Development Flow for Prisma Cloud Compute Custom Runtime Rules

## Introduction
This directory is dedicated to the development and collaboration processes specific to Prisma Cloud Compute Custom Runtime Rules within the STIGFUSION-PRISMAVIGIL project. It aims to provide clear guidelines and resources for effectively developing, managing, and collaborating on these custom rules.

## Development Workflow Overview
The development of Custom Runtime Rules in Prisma Cloud Compute involves several key steps:

1. **Rule Conceptualization**: Identifying the security requirements and defining the objectives of the custom runtime rule.
2. **Development**: Writing the rule logic based on Prisma Cloud Compute capabilities.
3. **Testing**: Validating the rule in a controlled environment to ensure it behaves as expected.
4. **Documentation**: Documenting the rule's purpose, logic, and any relevant details.
5. **Collaboration**: Working with team members to review, refine, and approve the rule.
6. **Deployment**: Integrating the rule into the Prisma Cloud Compute environment for active monitoring.

## Collaboration and Version Control
We use Git for version control and collaboration. It is crucial for team members to regularly commit changes and participate in peer reviews through pull requests. This ensures a transparent development process and maintains the integrity of our rule set.
